Package to play around with elementary functions.
Create, evaluate, compose, plot, ... functions.
May not be 100% bug-free and is not foolproof.
Has this annoying feature where the strings of the functions are sometimes messy / unsanitized (eg. 2*x-2*x instead of 0).
Feel free to contribute / edit / fix / improve any parts of the code.
